First written in 1991 and updated till 1993, Yasser wrote the ARABART library which added Arabic support in the DOS graphic mode which allowed him to create programs that display Arabic in different fonts, colors and styles. The library supports auto-shaping (choosing which letter form to use, ie. connected from the beginning, both sides, or end). This program serves as a demo to showcase all the capabilities of the ARABART library.
