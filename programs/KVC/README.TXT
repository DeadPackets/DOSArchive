This software was written as an antivirus for a locally created virus in Egypt called Koko that would wipe infected computers' hard drives. Koko was at the time undetected by any available antiviruses, so Yasser and his colleague Ibrahim wrote this antivirus as a framework with hopes to expand it to include other viruses in the future.
