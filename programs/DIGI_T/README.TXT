Written in 1993, this software is a part of Yasser's graduation project which involved the simulation and testing of digital circuits. This software is the GUI of the graduation project, running on DOS. Additionally, this graduation project included a custom made board and interface with the computer in order to analyze, simulate and reveal faulty ICs. Despite still being able to construct and simulate circuits, due to lack of hardware we cannot view the Truth Table generated or analyze the circuit for faults. To see the circuit used in the graduation defense, load the file "KEMYAM".
