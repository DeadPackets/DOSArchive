        <h2>The Programmer</h2>
        <p>
          In the early 1990s, <strong>Yasser Awad</strong> was a young programmer
          in <strong>Port Said, Egypt</strong>. Armed with a PC and a deep understanding
          of Assembly, C, and C++, he built software that solved real problems &mdash;
          from Arabic text rendering to digital circuit simulation, from virus removal
          to educational software.
        </p>
        <p>
          His work spanned three prolific years from <span class="text-amber">1991</span>
          to <span class="text-amber">1993</span>. During this time, he created a
          foundational Arabic graphics library (ARABART), won a programming competition,
          built an antivirus for a local virus, and crafted the software for his
          graduation project &mdash; a digital circuit simulator with custom hardware.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each program tells a story: interview assignments that launched a career,
          boot screens traded for a first computer mouse, gifts created for doctors
          and government offices, and a commercial demo for a local hardware store.
          Together, they form a portrait of a programmer's life in early-90s Egypt.

        <h2>The Archive</h2>
        <p>
          DOSArchive was built by <strong>Youssef Awad</strong>
          (<a href="https://github.com/DeadPackets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeadPackets</a>)
          to preserve his father's work and make it accessible to anyone with a web browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using <strong>js-dos</strong> &mdash; a DOSBox emulator compiled to WebAssembly &mdash;
          every program runs directly in the browser, exactly as it would have on a 1990s PC.
          No installation, no emulator setup. Just click and run.
        </p>
        <p>
          These programs were written for DOS, an operating system that has been obsolete
          for decades. Without preservation efforts like this, they would exist only as
          forgotten files on aging floppy disks. Now they live on the web, accessible to
          anyone, anywhere.
